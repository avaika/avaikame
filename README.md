A simple django based blog to post some bits on my travel and some random experience.
Mostly it was written just for fun. Nothing special at all. I didn't even cover it with tests...

A running copy is available at https://avaika.me

If you see some ugly stuff which makes you cry, feel free to send a pull request :)

PS. One day I will release automated server configuration / deployment part. It's way too raw to be released right now.
